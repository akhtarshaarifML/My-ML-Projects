2. Classification of Cancer as Benign or Malignant using ANN and visualising on Tensorboard (Libraries - Tensorflow, sklearn, numpy, pandas,seaborn,matplotlib)
3. Analysing the pattern of 911 Calls in USA based on Reasons, Dates, Months and Regions, using Exploratory Data Analysis.(Libraries - numpy,pandas,seaborn,plotly)
4. Finance Data( Bank Stocks) Exploratory Data Analysis using visualization libraries.
5. Linear Regression Modelling to compare the efficacy of different business/branding strategies of a Company on its Yearly Revenues, so as to suggest optimization of bussiness     strategy. (Libraries - sklearn, statsmodel,numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
